**HackBio Cancer Oncology 2024 Internship**

**Overview of HackBio and the Project Focus**

The HackBio Cancer Oncology 2024 internship offered a platform to explore computational biology, bioinformatics, and drug discovery. Our project aimed to develop a streamlined process for identifying bioactive compounds targeting cancer, integrating computational tools and machine learning to accelerate therapeutic discovery.

**Why Drug Development is Crucial for the Future**

With rising resistance to existing therapies, new approaches are needed for cancer treatment. Traditional drug discovery is slow and costly, but computational methods—such as protein modeling, molecular docking, and machine learning—provide faster, cost-effective alternatives by accurately predicting drug-target interactions.

**Overview**

The project is divided into four stages, with complete details provided in the repository files.

**Key Outcomes and Skills Gained**

This project provided hands-on experience with tools such as PyMOL, AutoDock Vina, SWISS-MODEL, and AlphaFold. We learned to build reusable drug discovery pipelines, apply machine learning for bioactivity predictions, and strengthen teamwork and communication skills through collaborative tasks and technical presentations.
